# Find neighbor IRI nodes

**Neighbors are IRI nodes that are mutually connected and that communicate directly with each other on the same IOTA network.**

1. Go to the #nodesharing channel on [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/fNGZXvh)
2. Ask for the URL or IP address of someone's IRI node, and give that person the URL or IP address of your IRI node. We recommend connecting to between 6 and 7 neighbor IRI nodes.
3. Add the URLs or IP addresses of your neighbor IRI nodes to the [`NEIGHBORS`](references/iri-configuration-options.md#neighbors) configuration parameter
