# Find neighbor IRI nodes

**To synchronize the transactions in their ledgers with the rest of the network, IRI nodes must communicate with other IRI nodes, which are called neighbors. To find neighbor IRI nodes on the same network, you must ask the owners for the URL or IP address of their IRI nodes and give them yours.**

1. Go to the #nodesharing channel on [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/fNGZXvh)
2. Ask for the URL or IP address of someone's IRI node, and give that person the URL or IP address of your IRI node. We recommend connecting to between 6 and 7 neighbor IRI nodes.
3. Add the URLs or IP addresses of your neighbor IRI nodes to the [`NEIGHBORS`](../references/iri-configuration-options.md#neighbors) configuration parameter
