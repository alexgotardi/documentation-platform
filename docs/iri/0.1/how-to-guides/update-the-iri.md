# Update the IRI

**The IRI is in a beta development stage, so it's likely to change, meaning that you'll need to update it.**

When a new version of the [IRI is released on GitHub](https://github.com/iotaledger/releases), we recommend that you update your local IRI to the new version.

1. Stop the IRI
2. Delete the mainnetdb folder, the mainnet.log file, and your current IRI .jar file
3. Download the latest IRI
4. [Run the IRI](../how-to-guides/run-an-iri-node.md)
