# Transaction validation

**Each IRI node in an IOTA network is responsible for validating transactions to make sure that conterfeit transactions are never confirmed.**

To protect the integrity of the ledger, IRI nodes append only valid transaction to their [ledgers](concepts/the-ledger.md).

IRI nodes validate transactions during the following stages:
- On receipt of new transactions
- During the tip selection process

## Transaction validation on receipt of new transactions

IRI nodes receive new transactions from both clients and neighbor nodes.

When an IRI node receives a new transaction, the transaction validator checks it for the following:

- The proof of work was done
- The value of any transaction in the bundle doesn’t exceed the total global supply
- The transaction is not older than the last snapshot and not newer than two hours ahead of the node’s current time

## Validation during the tip selection process

When clients asks an IRI node for tip transactions, it does the [tip selection process](concepts/tip-selection.md).

The bundles of each transaction that the IRI node traverses during the tip selection process are checked by the bundle validator and the ledger validator.

### Bundle validator

The bundle validator makes sure that all transactions in a bundle are valid.

During a [weighted random walk](concepts/tip-selection.md), the bundle validator checks the bundle of transactions for the following:

- The value of any transaction in the bundle doesn’t exceed the total global supply
- The total value of all transactions in the bundle is 0 (inputs and outputs are balanced)
- Any signatures are valid in value transactions

### Ledger validator

The ledger validator makes sure that double-spends are never confirmed

During a [weighted random walk](concepts/tip-selection.md), the ledger validator checks that each bundle does not lead to a double spend by checking the values of all addresses in a bundle. If a double-spend is found, the weighted random walk steps back one transaction and finds another route to a tip transaction.
