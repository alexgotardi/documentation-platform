A transaction in IOTA consists of 2673 trytes (if encoded). When you decode the trytes you get a transaction object which has the following values:

| Field                         | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Length |
| ----------------------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| signatureMessageFragment      | String | In case there is a spent input, the signature of the private key is stored here. If no signature is required, it is empty (all 9's) and can be used for storing the message value when making a transfer. More to that later. | 2187   |
| address                       | String | In case this is an output, then this is the address of the recipient. In case it is an input, then it is the address of the input which is used to send the tokens from (i.e. address generated from the private key)         | 81     |

| bundle                        | String | Hash of the current Bundle, which is used for grouping transactions of the bundle together. With the bundle hash you can identify transactions which were in the same bundle.                                                 | 81     |
