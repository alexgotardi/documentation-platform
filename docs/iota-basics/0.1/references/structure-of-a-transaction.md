# Structure of a transaction

**This table displays a list of fields that form a transaction.** 

A transaction consists of 2673 tryte-encoded characters. When decoded, the transaction object has these fields.

| Field                         | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Length (trytes) |
| :----------------------------- | :------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------ |
| `signatureMessageFragment`      | string | Contains either a signature or a message, both of which may be fragmented over multiple transactions in a bundle. This field contains a signature if the transaction spends IOTA tokens. Otherwise, this field contains all 9's and can contain a tryte-encoded message. | 2187   |
| `address`                       | string | Contains either a recipient's address or the address from which IOTA tokens are being spent. This field contains a recipient's address if the transaction is an output. Otherwise, this field contains an address from which IOTA tokens are being spent (transaction with a negative `value` field).   | 81     |
| `value`                    | integer    | Amount of IOTA tokens to credit or debit the address                                                                                                                                                                                            | 27     |

| `nonce`                         | string | Trytes that represent the amount of times the contents of a transaction must be hashed to check the [proof of work](root://the-tangle/0.1/concepts/proof-of-work.md).                                      | 27     |
