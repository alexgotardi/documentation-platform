The Mainnet, as the name suggests, is the main IOTA network. The network began operating in 2016 and has maintained ledger balances since then. This network houses the **native** IOTA token and is used by the public to transact data and value multiple times a second.

The Mainnet uses manual peering in order to construct a peer-2-peer network. This combined with nodes not sharing their neighbour information leads to an inability to map the IOTA Network. This means that it's currently impossible to map the network or know how many nodes currently comprise the IOTA Mainnet.

#Nodes

In order to use the IOTA Tangle you have to interact with the nodes that make up the IOTA Mainnet.

These nodes are run by community members, businesses & the Foundation. While these groups run nodes, they often don't share the public urls of their node. Running a node incurs a cost and high volume of API calls on a node can put it under load. Due to this its suggested that a user sets up a node so they have direct access to the Mainnet.

If you are unable to setup your own node you can find pre-configured nodes within the Trinity Wallet or you can use websites that list publicly shared nodes such as [IOTA Dance](https://iota.dance)
