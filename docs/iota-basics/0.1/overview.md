## IOTA Token

The IOTA Token is a `cryptotoken` built upon the Tangle technology. The native token benefits from the advantages of this new Tangle architecture.

The token operates on a permission-less Tangle network known as the **Mainnet**. Individuals are able to interact with this network by operating a full node that is peered with neighbors. Alternatively they are able to public Mainnet nodes operated by a third party.

### Token Generation

All IOTA's which will ever exist have been created with the genesis transaction. This means that the total supply of IOTA's will always stay the same and you cannot "mine" IOTA's. Therefore keep in mind, if you do Proof of Work in IOTA you are not generating new IOTA tokens, you're simply verifying other transactions.

### Token Supply

The total supply of IOTA is `(3^33-1) / 2`, which equals to a total number of IOTA's of `2779530283277761`. IOTA is specifically designed for machines, so this high supply makes IOTA optimal for tiny **nano-transactions** while still keeping efficiency in mind.

This supply fits nicely into the `MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` value in Javascript.

### Supply Etymology

Since the number of tokens is quite high we adhere to the SI notation to write in short hand to denote a large number of tokens. Here is a breakdown of the notation:

| Unit | Name       | Amount                | Powers          |
| ---- | ---------- | --------------------- | --------------- |
| Pi   | Peta IOTA  | 1.000.000.000.000.000 | 10<sup>15</sup> |
| Ti   | Terra IOTA | 1.000.000.000.000     | 10<sup>12</sup> |
| Gi   | Giga IOTA  | 1.000.000.000         | 10<sup>9</sup>  |
| Mi   | Mega IOTA  | 1.000.000             | 10<sup>6</sup>  |
| Ki   | Kila IOTA  | 1.000                 | 10<sup>3</sup>  |
| i    | IOTA       | 1                     | 10<sup>1</sup>  |
