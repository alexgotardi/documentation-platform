# Addresses and signatures

**An address is a public string of characters that can contain IOTA tokens for a particular seed. To spend from an address, you must create an input transaction that contains a valid signature.**

Addresses and signatures are generated by an algorithm that uses public/private key cryptography.

In cryptography, public and private keys come in pairs that are bound together by a cryptographic algorithm. Private keys are the secret half of the pair. This half is used to create signatures that prove ownership of the public key. Public keys are the public half of the pair. This half can be sent to anyone without any risk.

## How addresses are generated

Addresses are the public half that's generated from a private key.

Each private key is generated from a seed, an index, and a security level.

As long as the same seed, index, and security level are used, the same addresses and signatures are generated. If the index changes, but the security level doesn't, a new address is generated. If the security level changes, but the index doesn't, a new address is generated.

**Tip:** Try [generating different addresses with Node JS](../how-to-guides/generate-an-address.md).

### Security levels

The [security level of an address](../references/security-levels-of-addresses.md) determines the length of the address's signature.

Because a transaction's [`signatureMessageFragment` field](../references/structure-of-a-transaction.md) can contain only a certain number of trytes, any input address with a security level higher than 1 must fragment the rest of the signature over zero-value output transactions. For example, the signature of an address with a security level of 2 must be fragmented over two transactions.

### Address reuse

Because IOTA uses a Winternitz one-time signature scheme to sign transaction, you should **never** spend from an address more than once. 

If you spend from an address more than once, a sophisticated attacker can brute force its signature and steal the IOTA tokens in it. 

## Signatures

Anyone can use Tangle explorers such as [thetangle.org](https://thetangle.org/) to search for an address and find out how many IOTA tokens are in it.

As a result, clients need a way of proving that they own the address.

To prove ownership, input transactions must be signed with the private key that was used to generate the address.

This signature is put into the [`signatureMessageFragment` field](../references/structure-of-a-transaction.md) of a transaction. IRI nodes use the address to verify the signature.
