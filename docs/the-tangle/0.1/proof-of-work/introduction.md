# What is Proof of Work

Proof of Work (PoW) is a piece of data with specific requirements which is difficult to produce but easy for others to verify. Producing a PoWis generally a random process with low probability so, on average, a large amount of trial and error is required before a valid proof of work is generated. 

## Origins

Originally it was introduced as a concept to reduce email spam. Knowen as Hashcash, it proposed a method to prevent email spam, requiring a proof of work on the email's contents on every email. 

Legitimate emails will be able to do the work to generate the proof easily (not much work is required for a single email), but mass spam emailers will have difficulty generating the required proofs (which would require huge computational resources).

## IOTA's Proof of Work

IOTA uses a similar approach to Hashcash by requiring Proof of Work on transactions to be completed by the sender of the transaction. This is in contrast to 'traditional' distributed ledger Proof of Work which is a competitive, dynamically adjusted Proof of Work used to determine to reciptent of a reward.
