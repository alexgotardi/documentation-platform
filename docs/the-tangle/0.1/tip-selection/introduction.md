# What is Tip Selection

> Note: These sections are **advanced** its suggested for beginners to start learning about Tip Selection in the IOTA Basics section.

In order for a transaction to join the Tangle, a new transaction must choose two previous ones to approve. In general, it will choose two previously unapproved transactions, or _tips_. 

The method for choosing these two tips is called the _tip selection algorithm_. This algorithim, while embedded into the IOTA node software, isn't *enforced* within the network. There has work done to ensure that there is an incentive to use the standard _tip selection algorithim_ and ensure that the network operates smoothly. 

The following two sections explain in-depth both [Tip Selection](tip-selection) and the [Incentives](incentives) to participate honestly within the network.
