### Connect to a custom node

Trinity provides a built-in node-balancing service for optimal performance. Every time you open your wallet, Trinity selects a healthy node with a low load.

You may want to select a custom node to connect to. For example, if you run your own IRI node.

To do so, go to **Settings** > **Node**, and enter the URL or IP address of an IRI node.
