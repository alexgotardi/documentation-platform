# Receiving a transaction

Before senders can send you a transaction, they must have an address to send it to.

Remember that if you send a transaction that spends IOTA tokens from one of your addresses, you can't reuse that address. Instead, you must generate a new address.

1. Click **Receive**
2. Click **Sync address** (**Generate address** on a mobile device) to generate a new address
3. Either copy the address and send it to the sender, or send the QR code instead.

    **Important:** On Android devices, any application can read the content of keyboard presses and modify it. Be careful when pasting an address into another app and make sure that the address you have pasted is the same one that you copied.

When you either receive or send a transaction, it appears on the home page. Click a transaction from the list to view information about it.

**Note:** The addresses field is displayed only in [Advanced mode](how-to-guides/changing-the-settings.md).
