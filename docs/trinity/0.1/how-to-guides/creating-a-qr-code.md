# Creating a QR Code that Trinity can read

To avoid making senders enter all 81 characters of a recipient's address, Trinity can read addresses in QR codes.

QR codes enable IOTA payments for recipients such as ecommerce websites. By putting a QR code on a payment page, customers can scan the code to auto-populate the Address field with the vendor's address.

1. Go to [goqr.me](http://goqr.me)
2. Copy and paste your address in the Text field
3. Download or embed the generated QR code
4. Send the QR code to your sender, or add it to your website

When the sender scans the QR code in Trinity, the Address field will be populated with your address.
