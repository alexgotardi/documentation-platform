# Change the advanced settings

**Advanced settings affect the functionality of Trinity. Change the advanced settings if you're familiar with how IOTA works.**

## Change the proof-of-work settings

Before you send a transaction, proof of work must be done to make it valid. Proof of work requires a computer to use energy to do computations. By default proof of work is done on the computer that is running Trinity.

To have the proof of work be done by the IRI node that Trinity is connected to, change this setting to **Remote**.

## Change the auto-promotion settings

To make sure that transactions are confirmed, it may be necessary to auto-promote (promote and reattach) them. By default, Trinity auto-promotes transactions until they're confirmed.

To stop Trinity from auto-promoting transactions, change this setting to **Disabled**.

**Note:** Trinity does not auto-promote transactions if it's minimized (not open).
