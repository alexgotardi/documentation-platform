# Managing your account

For each of your accounts, you can do the following:
* Access your seed (not available if you use a hardware wallet)
* View your addresses and their available balance
* Change the name of an account

Make sure that you select the correct account to manage before completing any of these tasks.

To access Account management on a mobile device, go to **Settings** > **Account management**.

To access Account management on a desktop, go to the burger menu >  **Account** > **Account management**.

## Accessing the seed of an account

Each account that you create uses a different seed, which you must back up.

To access the seed go to Account management, and click **View seed**.

## Viewing the addresses of an account

Each seed can be used to generate an almost limitless amount of addresses.

To view the addresses that you've generated, go to Account management, and click **View addresses**.

## Changing the name of an account

To make it easier to manage multiple accounts, you can give each of them a unique name.

To change the name of an account, go to Account management, and click **Account name**.

## Changing your login password

Trinity stores your seeds for you (unless you use a [hardware wallet](concepts/hardware-wallet.md)) and allows you to log in with a password.

To change the login password on a desktop, go to **Settings** > **Change password**.

To change the login password on a mobile device, go to **Settings** > **Security settings** > **Change password**.
