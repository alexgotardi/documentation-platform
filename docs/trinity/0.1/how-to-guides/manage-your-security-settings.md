## Set up two-factor authentication

Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a security process in which you provide two different authentication factors to log into Trinity.

2FA provides an extra layer of security by relying on not only a password, but also a 2FA code from a third-party application.

1. Click **Two-factor authentication**
2. Copy and paste the key into a third-party 2FA application such as [Google 2-step verification](https://www.google.com/landing/2step/)
3. Copy and paste the code from the third-party 2FA application into Trinity
4. Click **Done**

Whenever you want to log into Trinity, you'll be prompted to enter this 2FA code after you enter your password.

## Set up biometric authentication

Biometric authentication is a security process, which allows you to log into Trinity with your fingerprint.

1. Click **Biometric authentication**
2. Click **Enable**
3. Click **Done**

Whenever you want to log into Trinity, you'll have the option to log in using your fingerprint or your password.
