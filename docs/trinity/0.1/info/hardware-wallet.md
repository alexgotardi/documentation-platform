## Hardware Wallet Security

In addition to robust built-in security, hardware wallets are also supported by Trinity.  Hardware wallets provide one storage location for muliple currency accounts.  For example, you may have a Bitcoin account and an IOTA seed.  To identify these different accounts, an account index is used.

You may also store multiple accounts within one type of currency.  For example, two IOTA seeds.  

A hardware wallet stores your seed within the hardware device.  Currently, Ledger Nano S Hardware Wallet is supported.  It is fully integrated with Trinity but it runs on the Tangle.  Your seed is not stored in Trinity but on the Tangle.  For details and installation instructions, see [Ledger Nano S](https://trinity.iota.org/hardware)

Future hardware wallets will also be supported including:  Trezor and Blue Ledger
