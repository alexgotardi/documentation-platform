# Send a transaction

**Trinity allows you to send transactions to a one address at a time.**

If you have multiple accounts in your Trinity wallet, make sure that you select the correct account from the dropdown menu.

1. Click **Send**
2. Enter a recipient's address
    
   **Important:** On Android devices, any application can read the content of keyboard presses and modify it. Be careful when pasting an address into Trinity and make sure that the address you have pasted is the same one that you copied.

3. Enter either a message, or an amount of IOTA tokens, or both

    **Note:** The amount to send can be entered in IOTA or in the [currency of your choice](how-to-guides/changing-the-settings.md). Pay close attention to the IOTA units (i, Mi, Gi,) that you're sending.
