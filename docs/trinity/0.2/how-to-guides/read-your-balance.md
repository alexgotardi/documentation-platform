# Read your balance

**Trinity regularly updates your balance by asking the IRI nodes in the network for the balance of all addresses associated with your seed.**

Your total balance is displayed at the top of the home page. You can also [view the balance of individual addresses](how-to-guides/manage-your-account.md#view-the-addresses-of-an-account).

Think your balance is incorrect? Read our [troubleshooting guide](how-to-guides/troubleshooting.md#incorrect-balance).
