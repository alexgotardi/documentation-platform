# Install Hub

**In this guide, you'll create a multi-user wallet using Hub. After you complete this guide you'll be able to interact with Hub to create new users with any programming language that supports gRPC.**

For this guide, you'll use a new installation of [Ubuntu 18.04 LTS](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/server).

![IOTA Hub architecture](../iota_hub.png)

To get started with Hub, do the following:

1. Install the dependencies
2. Install the database server
3. Build Hub
4. Create the database
5. Run Hub
6. Test Hub

## Install the dependencies

Hub needs to be compiled from source using the dependencies.

1. Make sure that the local apt repository is up to date and contains the multiverse repository

	```bash
	$ sudo apt update
	```

2. Install a compiler, such as GCC, Clang, or a toolchain from [@iota_toolchains](https://github.com/iotaledger/toolchains)

	```bash
	$ sudo apt install gcc-7
	```

3. Install the dependencies for the Bazel binary installer

	```bash
	$ sudo apt install pkg-config zip g++ zlib1g-dev unzip python
	```

4. Download the binary installer for the [latest version of Bazel](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases)

	```bash
	$ wget https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases/download/0.18.0/bazel-0.18.0-installer-linux-x86_64.sh
	```

5. Make sure that you can execute the installer script

	```bash
	$ chmod +x bazel-0.18.0-installer-linux-x86_64.sh
	```

6. Install Bazel under your active user using the `--user` flag:

	```bash
	$ ./bazel-0.18.0-installer-linux-x86_64.sh --user
	```

7. Install the `pyparsing` package for Python

	```bash
	$ sudo apt install python-pyparsing
	```

8. Install Git

	```bash
	$ sudo apt install git
	```

## Install the database server

Hub needs a database (MariaDB 10.2.1+) in which to store data such as users, addresses, and balances.

The default repositories for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS don't provide a package that can be used for the database. Instead, install a custom Personal Package Archive (PPA) for the official MariaDB repository.

1. Create a GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) key for the PPA

	```bash
	sudo apt-key adv --recv-keys --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 0xF1656F24C74CD1D8
	```

2. Add the MariaDB repository
	
```bash
sudo add-apt-repository 'deb [arch=amd64,arm64,ppc64el] http://ftp.utexas.edu/mariadb/repo/10.3/ubuntu bionic main'
```

3. update the package list

```bash
sudo apt update
```

4. Install the MariaDB server

```bash
sudo apt install mariadb-server
```

During the installation, you'll be prompted to enter a root password for MariaDB. Enter a secure password and remember it. You will need it later on.

![MariaDB password prompt](../mariapassword.png "Choose your password")

5. Make sure that MySQL is installed

	```bash
	mysql --version
	```

The output should display something like the following:

```shell
mysql  Ver 15.1 Distrib 10.3.10-MariaDB, for debian-linux-gnu (x86_64) using readline 5.2
```
 
Here, you can see that MariaDB 10.3.10 is installed, which is a higher version than the minimum of 10.2.1.

## Build Hub

After setting up all these dependencies it's time to install Hub.

1. Clone the GitHub repository

	```bash
	git clone https://github.com/iotaledger/rpchub.git
	```

2. Change into the `hub` directory

	```bash
	cd hub
	```

3. Build Hub from the source code:

	```bash
	bazel build -c opt //hub:hub
	```

This process can take a while, depending on the hardware or virtual machine.

After the build is complete, the output should display something like the following:

```shell
Target //hub:hub up-to-date:
	bazel-bin/hub/hub
INFO: Elapsed time: 1531.342s, Critical Path: 208.27s
INFO: 1377 processes: 1377 linux-sandbox.
INFO: Build completed successfully, 1811 total actions
```

## Create the database

After Hub is installed, you need to create the database tables that store Hub's data.

**Important:** In these commands, make sure to replace the `myrootpassword` placeholder with the root password you chose when you installed MariaDB.

1. Create a database called hub

	```bash
	echo "CREATE DATABASE hub" | mysql -uroot -pmyrootpassword
	```

2. Load the database schema from the Hub source code into the database

	```bash
	mysql -h127.0.0.1 -uroot -pmyrootpassword hub < schema/schema.sql
	```

3. Import the database triggers

	```bash
	mysql -h127.0.0.1 -uroot -pmyrootpassword hub < schema/triggers.mariadb.sql
	```

## Run Hub

To run Hub, you need to execute the binary file that was created during the build process. This binary file is located in the `./bazel-bin/hub/hub` directory.

Before you can run the binary file, you need to configure it.

1. Create a shell script file called start.sh

	```bash
	nano start.sh
	```

2. In the start.sh file, add the command for running hub with the configuration options

	```shell
	#!/bin/bash
		
	./bazel-bin/hub/hub \
		--salt CHANGETHIS \
		--db hub \
		--dbUser root \
		--dbPassword myrootpassword \
		--apiAddress 127.0.0.1:14265 \
		--minWeightMagnitude 14 \
		--listenAddress 127.0.0.1:50051
	```

**Important:** Change the value of the `salt` flag to a long, private string of characters. This value is used by Hub to generate seeds.

To view the available [configuration options](references/hub-configuration-options.md), do the following:

```bash
./bazel-bin/hub/hub --help
```

3. Make the shell script executable

	```bash
	chmod a+x start.sh
	```

4. Run the shell script to start Hub

	```bash
	./start.sh
	```

Congratulations :tada: Hub is now running on your computer! 

**Note:** You are currently running Hub in your shell session. If you close this session, Hub will stop. Therefore, you might want to consider running Hub in a screen/tmux session, a system-wide service, or a supervised process.

For this tutorial, you'll use supervisor to make sure that Hub always runs and automatically restarts after a reboot or a crash. 

5. Install supervisor (press `CTRL+C` to exit the current shell session):

	```bash
	sudo apt install supervisor
	```

6. Create a configuration file for supervisor

	```bash
	sudo nano /etc/supervisor/conf.d/hub.conf
	```

7. Add the following lines to the hub.conf file:

	```shell
	[program:hub]
	command=/home/dave/hub/start.sh
	directory=/home/dave/hub/
	user=dave
	autostart=true
	autorestart=true
	stderr_logfile=/home/dave/hub/err.log
	stdout_logfile=/home/dave/hub/info.log
	```

**Note:** Change the value of the `user` parameter, and make sure that the paths in the `command`, `directory`, `stderr_logfile`, and `stdout_logfile` parameters are correct.

8. Save the hub.conf file and reload supervisor

	```bash
	sudo supervisorctl reload
	```

Hub should now be running in the background and should automatically start again after a server reboot or a crash.

9. Check the supervisor status

	```bash
	sudo supervisorctl status
	```

The output should display something like this:

```shell
hub                              RUNNING   pid 9983, uptime 0:01:22
```

## Test Hub

On startup, Hub provides a gRPC server for you to interact with. Hub has a [limited set of gRPC calls](references/api-reference.md) that can be used to interact it.

You can communicate with Hub through any programming language that supports [gRPC](https://grpc.io/). In this guide, you'll use Python.

1. Download the sample code from GitHub

	```bash
	cd ~
	git clone https://github.com/fijter/rpchub-test.git
	cd rpchub-test
	```

2. This example code has dependencies. To avoid installing the dependencies in your global Python environment, create a Virtual Environment

	```bash
	sudo apt-add-repository multiverse && sudo apt update
	sudo apt install  python3-venv
	python3 -m venv env
	```

3. Activate the virtual environment in a shell session

	```bash
	. env/bin/activate
	```

4. Install the dependencies

	```bash
	pip install -r requirements.txt
	```
  
5. Create a new user account in Hub

	```bash
	python examples/create_user.py
	```

The output should display the following:

```shell
 New user with id 'user-1' created!
 ```

6. Generate a new deposit address for the user

	```bash
	python examples/get_address.py
	```

The output should display a new deposit address for user-1. Feel free to send it a couple of IOTA tokens to try it out with [Trinity](root://trinity/0.1/introduction/overview.md)!

7. Get the balance and history for the user  

	```bash
	python examples/balance.py
	```

If you sent IOTA tokens to the deposit address, the output should display something like the following:

```shell
10i available for test 'user-1'
History:
events {
	timestamp: 1540856214000
	type: DEPOSIT
	amount: 10
}
```

If you look at the deposit address history in a tangle explorer such as [thetangle.org](https://thetangle.org/), you will see that Hub moved the funds away from the deposit address and into a hot wallet. This process is called a sweep.

## Next steps

**Optional:** Improve the security of Hub by adding the [signing server](how-to-guides/install-the-signing-server.md).
