# IOTA networks

IOTA has three [permissionless networks](concepts/distributed-ledger-technology.md) (public) that anyone can use:
* MainNet
* DevNet
* SpamNet

If you want to create and test an application on a permissioned network (private), you can do so by running [Compass](compass/introduction/overview.md).

## MainNet

When you buy IOTA tokens from a cryptocurrency exchange, you can send those token to addresses on the MainNet network.

## DevNet

The DevNet network is an exact copy of the MainNet network for developers. On this network, you can test your applications and build proof of concepts that use [free DevNet tokens](https://faucet.testnet.iota.org).

## SpamNet

The SpamNet network is for applications that spam transactions.
