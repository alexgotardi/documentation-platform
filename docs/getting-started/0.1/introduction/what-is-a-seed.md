# What is a seed?

**A seed is a secret password that's used to generate unique addresses and digital signatures.**

Addresses are the accounts from which [transactions](introduction/what-is-a-transaction.md) are sent and received.

Digital signatures prove ownership of an address and allow value transactions to be sent from addresses.

A seed can generate an almost unlimited amount of addresses: Enough that you don't need to worry about ever running out!
