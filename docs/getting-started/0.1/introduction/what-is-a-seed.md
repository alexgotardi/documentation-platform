# What is a seed?

**A seed is a secret password that's used to generate unique addresses and signatures.**

Addresses are the accounts from which [transactions](../introduction/what-is-a-transaction.md) are sent and received.

Signatures prove ownership of an address and allow IOTA tokens to be spent from addresses.

A seed can generate an almost unlimited amount of addresses (9,007,199,254,740,992, to be exact): Enough that you don't need to worry about ever running out!

Get started and [create your own seed](../tutorials/create-a-seed.md)!
