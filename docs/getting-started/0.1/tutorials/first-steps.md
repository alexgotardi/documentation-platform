# First steps

**IOTA is designed to be a lightweight platform on which applications can be built.**

## Developers

You can get started with IOTA by [running your own IRI node](../tutorials/run-your-own-iri-node.md) and [sending your first data transaction with Node.js](../tutorials/send-your-first-data-transaction-with-nodejs.md).

## Non-developers

If you want to see how IOTA works without having to write code, you can [send your first data transaction with the Trinity wallet](../tutorials/send-your-first-data-transaction-with-the-trinity-wallet.md).
