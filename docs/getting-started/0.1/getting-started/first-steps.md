# First steps

IOTA is designed to be a lightweight platform on which applications can be built for different [use cases](references/use-cases.md).

If you're a developer, you can get started with IOTA by [running your own IRI node](getting-started/running-your-own-iri-node.md) and [sending your first data transaction with Node.js](getting-started/sending-your-first-data-transaction-with-nodejs.md).

If you want to see how IOTA works without having to write code, you can [send your first data transaction with the Trinity wallet](getting-started/sending-your-first-data-transaction-with-the-trinity-wallet.md).
